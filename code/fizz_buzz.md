# FizzBuzz
This is an annotated walk through of the [`FizzBuzz` kata][fizzbuzz]. The goal
is to demonstrate the [_4 rules of simple design_][design].

## Requirements
Create a function that accepts a number `n` and returns

1. `"Fizz"` if `n` is divisible by 3.
2. `"Buzz"` if `n` is divisible by 5.
3. `"FizzBuzz"` if `n` divisible by both 3 and 5.
4. Otherwise, a string representations of `n`.
