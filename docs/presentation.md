## Tale

* Lightning crackles through the sky, illuminating your grim face.
* You stayed up late, but that is fine. You couldn't sleep anyway.
* Nervously you eye your phone, checking for the humpth time if it is on.
* Your rest your weary head.
* "I am just going to close my eyes for a little while", you tell your self.
* **Ring**
* You are startled by the noise that you have been dreading all night.
* **Ring**
* You answer your phone: "The integration module is acting up"
* The words you wish you had misheard echo in your brain.
* You open your laptop, far from ready, to battle the monsters of your nightmare.
